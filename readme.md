## Laravel Admin Panel ***** Work In Progress *****

Is there a need for something like this ? Yes it is .

Why ?

## CRUD Management 
CRUD is repetitive task . Laravel Admin Panel makes CRUD a breeze with just 2 clicks .

## CRUD Management with Relationships - WIP
Simple CRUD is good for tables which are not linked to others or which are not related to other tables 
If i want to create a user table which has relationship with user_groups then this can be useful

## User Management - WIP
It will wrap all popular authentication systems like sentry , confide , buildin auth into adapter through which user management can be configured like user creations , user groups , groups , throttle etc .

## Cron Jobs- WIP
This really needs an interface 

Stay tuned !
